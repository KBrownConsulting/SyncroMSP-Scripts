ScreenConnect 23.9.8 Vulnerability Check
Author:         Karl Brown
Version:        1.0
Release Date:   2024-02-21
URL:            https://github.com/KBrownConsulting/SyncroMSP-Scripts/blob/main/ScreenConnect_Vulnerability_Check_v23.9.8

Changelog:
============================================
    1.0 - Initial Release

Description:
============================================
This script will search for vulnerable ScreenConnect processes running on a machine related to the critical
ScreenConnect vulnerability announced by ConnectWise on 2024-02-19:

https://www.connectwise.com/company/trust/security-bulletins/connectwise-screenconnect-23.9.8
https://www.huntress.com/blog/a-catastrophe-for-control-understanding-the-screenconnect-authentication-bypass

If a vulnerable version is detected it will output info about the process including: process name, file path,
ScreenConnect version, and even try to detect and report the host and port of the associated ScreenConnect server!

It will also trigger a Syncro alert if the script detects it has been run from Syncro. 

Note: Version 23.9.8 is the version where the vulnerability was patched so we want to check and make sure all
      processes are running at least that version or newer. 

Requirements
============================================
 - I believe the script should run as is on nearly any powershell enabled Windows machine. 
 - Tested on Windows 10 & 11 with PowerShell 5. 
 - Works as is with or without Syncro. (Intilligently detects if launched by Syncro & only generates Syncro
   alerts if launched by Syncro.)


 
Potential Issues / False Positives
============================================
Because ScreenConnect makes it so easy to customize the name of the application, searching based on file or
process name is not reliable.  As a result this script simply checks the version number of any running process
that is signed by ConnectWise. (It also checks for processes signed by ScreenConnect to catch really old versions.) 

Due to this strategy, there is a good chance that other non ScreenConnect processes signed by ConnectWise running
on the system may be flagged as potentially vulnerable processes. 

Since I don't use any other ConnectWise software except ScreenConnect I have no easy way to test for this. The
information the script outputs should make it easy (I hope) to identify any false positives though.
